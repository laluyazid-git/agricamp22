    <h2>Why Organizing AgriCamp?</h2>
<p>This camp is held on 14-15 May 2022. The objective of this agricamp is to boost the Indonesian
  farmers on “how to create a sustainable environment for their coffee orchard” and to improve their
  coffee quality”. Yet a smallholder coffee community, they have a vision and mission to grow big
  within the sustainable smart-climate agriculture approach. For the last three years, they have been
  identifying obstacles as well as their potential in Lombok coffee and vanilla from seed to cup quality.
  One strategy to encourage these coffee farmers is to gain support from a few entities that have
  a strong background in the coffee industry, preferably those with research acquaintances.
  Therefore, one of the activities in this event is having talks/discussions with a few coffee experts.
  Their shared knowledge about coffee hopefully will increase the farmers’ self-esteem and skill that
  will eventually create a better sustainable livelihood.
